About a year ago, Sonar decided to introduce [DX](https://getdx.com/). I'll admit I was sceptical, and hesitant to introduce it to my engineers. Because, how can you possible hope to measure an activity like software engineering objectively? I won't dwell on why; many others have written about this and in ways I cannot hope to match. But I've come to _love_ using these tools, because I realize I was missing the point.

# Why engineers fear these tools


# Transparency and context over raw numbers


# The cardinal rule (metrics ≠ objectives)


# Looking at multiple metrics holistically


# Using percentiles to handle exceptions


# The real payoff (your bottleneck story)
