This week, I won't have any time to post an article. I'm attending the [Drupal Dev Days in Montpellier](http://montpellier2015.drupaldays.org/), France. I've been to Drupalcons before, but this is my first DDD. If you ever have the chance, I highly recommend it: it's very friendly, you get to participate on Core and you learn a lot.

I already have [a](https://www.drupal.org/node/2408265) [few](https://www.drupal.org/node/2390241) [patches](https://www.drupal.org/node/2469941) committed to Core, and [a](https://www.drupal.org/node/2130241) [few](https://www.drupal.org/node/2470233) [others](https://www.drupal.org/node/2299361) [that](https://www.drupal.org/node/2470069) are pending.

I also used this opportunity to sprint a bit on my own project called [Herald](https://www.drupal.org/project/herald). Herald is a suite of Drupal modules to build your own, Drupal-powered CI/QA center. I'm pretty happy with how it's going and its API. Go to the project page for more information. And I'm looking for co-maintainers. So, if you have experience with Drupal development and are also picky when it comes to code quality (and love geeky dashboards with sweet widgets), [ping me](https://www.drupal.org/user/440510/contact).
