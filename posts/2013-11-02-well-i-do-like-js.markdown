Ok folks, what's with all the JS hating out there? The post by [Julik Live](http://live.julik.nl/2013/05/javascript-is-shit) is getting tossed around the dev community, some calling it bulls\*#%, but others loudly &ldquo;agreeing&rdquo; (you turncoats).

## Me, I love Javascript

Yes it has its quirks, its WTFs; as many (all ?) languages do. But it has some great things going for it as well. 

I could list all the pros and cons of JS, but that's not what a language&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;or anything, for that matter&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;is about. That's being short-sighted. 

Working with a language is, in my opinion, like hanging out with a person. No-one's perfect. You will *never* find someone who's 100% great *all* the time. Yet that doesn't mean you don't *love* spending time with that person.

## It's not about the person, it's what that person brings out in you

Take a minute to look at all the *brilliant* stuff that exists in JS. Would people really have taken the time to build all that using a **shit language**? Of course not! Granted, some did not have a choice. But many of them chose JS because they *wanted* to use JS. Now think of all the total crap you've seen written in &ldquo;good&rdquo; languages. See what I'm getting at?

Would you say that a person that's ugly, or less clever, is always a shitty person? I hope not. 

Likewise, would you say a person that's beautiful and smart is automatically a great person? I hope not. 

If a very likable person is loved by hundreds, except you, than the problem is probably not with the person, but with you. 

If a language, like JS, is loved by thousands&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;many of them *very* smart an talented&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and used for exceptionally useful and beautiful applications, yet you discard it, then I say you have not taken the time to get to know the language that well or (more likely) haven't given it the chance it deserves.

For me, I worked with languages that are much more rigid and well thought-through than JS (no, I'm certainly **not** talking about PHP). But I still love working with JS. It's like meeting an old friend. We build great stuff together, and I enjoy (almost) every minute of it. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying JS is perfect. ***Far from it*** (some of Julik's points are totally valid). I'm not saying you *must* love JS either. We all have our preferences. But that does not mean it deserves to be hated and/or discarded as a language.

JS is an exceptional and fun tool, used for exceptional and fun projects. Period. 

Now, let's get back to coding (in the language of your choosing).
