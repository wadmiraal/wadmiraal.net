I love Drupal. I've been using it for almost 4 years now, and use it every day. I've coded countless modules over those years, dozens, maybe close to a hundred; I don't know.


## What I love about Drupal

Oh, gosh, where to start ?

It's very, *very* flexible and powerful.

It's modular structure makes for a clean and easily maintainable code-base.

The hook infrastructure makes it infinitely extensible.

The theme layer is a solid, clean approach to separating presentation from logic.

The fact that it's half framework, half product makes it ideal to quickly go live.

There are ***many*** incredible modules out there.

...and I could go on and on.


### Sure, it ain't perfect

Don't get me wrong. I love Drupal, but I ain't blind (am I ?).

It does not always follow best practices and standards. The drupal API has some parts that seriously need upgrading, and some *drupalisms* are just... \*shiver\*

But that's for another post... because, right now...


## ...I'm cursed

Drupal is *too* great. How's that, you may ask ?

As a passionate developer, I love trying out new tools and technologies. So do you, right ?

But as a professional, I must always answer the question: *&ldquo;what tool will we use to make sure this project will be **easy to maintain**, **update** and **fast to develop** ?&rdquo;* And the question is always: **Drupal**.

Sometimes a client comes along and has this fantastic idea. And I go, like: *Cool, this would be a great opportunity to try out framework XYZ or code this in language ABC.*

But then we start calculating delays, costs, etc.

And this annoying pattern emerges every single time (I'm talking medium to large scale applications here): it'll be faster and easier with Drupal.

It's true. It's absolutely true.

How often have we started out planning a project using other tools or frameworks we know, only to realise at some point: *&ldquo;Wait - Drupal has a bunch of modules that do this and that, so we could spend more time on this part. We already coded a module that does that over there, and...&rdquo;*.

And we stick with Drupal. Every time, again and again. Don't get me wrong: I'm (kinda) happy with this. Heck, I'm usually the most fierce Drupal evangelist.

But just once, I'd be happy to see a situation where we can honestly say: *&ldquo;Hey, this would be much easier if we use \[other framework name here\].&rdquo;*

Curse you, Drupal ;-) !
