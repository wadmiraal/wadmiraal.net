I'm a dutch guy, married to a beautiful french woman and living in Switzerland, in the old and gorgeous city of [Fribourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fribourg), which also has the particularity of having two official languages (French and German), despite being a city of only ~30'000.

Talk about a cultural mixup...

Anyhow...

I'm a &ldquo;full-stack&rdquo; web developer. As such, I have had the privilege of working on several great and challenging products. I do both front-end and the back-end development, although I consider myself more of a front-end specialist.

I studied interaction design, and as such am very picky when it comes to UX and beatiful UIs.

I work a *lot* with Drupal, and am the author of several modules on [www.drupal.org](http://www.drupal.org).

I *love* my job. Developing has become a passion and I enjoy (almost) every day I spend on the job.

Except coding and crafting intuitive UIs, I thoroughly enjoy reading.

Other than that, I like the classic, boring, I've-read-that-before-stuff, like movies, music, spending time with my family and friends, etc.

Eventhough I'm mainly a front-end developer, I try out many different languages and try to keep up with the rapidly changing technology landscape. At the time of writing, I'm digging into [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org).

Other than Javascript code, HTML markup and CSS styles, a large portion of my time goes into PHP and Drupal code.
